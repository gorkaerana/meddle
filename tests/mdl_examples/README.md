All examples except `logical_operator*` borrowed from their corresponding subsection in https://developer.veevavault.com/mdl/#mdl-commands-1. `logical_operator*` were borrowed from https://developer.veevavault.com/mdl/#mdl-operators.

`alter.mdl`, `logical_operator2.mdl`, and `logical_operator2.mdl` were modified as it breaks Veeva's own grammar by using comma's after components instead of semicolons.

`modify.mdl` and `add.mdl` were borrowed from within https://developer.veevavault.com/mdl/#alter.
